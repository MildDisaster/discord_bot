Learning python by trying to make a discord bot that does stuff

## considerations
I have no real seat time with python, this project is so I have something to learn on.
Most of it is probably not 'pythonic', or obnoxiously spaghettified.  It is what it is.

This is run as a single server bot.

## notes
I'm not providing dependancy lists or instructions how to deploy it.  
Almost anyone else's work will be better for you if you can not figure out these things on your own.

If there is any value here; certain snippets might be a decent example of how to ( or how not to ) do certain things, or solve certain problems.
